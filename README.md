# Supabase-Nextjs-Pen-and-Paper-Games

> Play classic pen & paper games online with friends or against AI  

## What is Pen&Paper?

Pen&Paper is a modern reimagining of nostalgic pen-and-paper games like **Tic-Tac-Toe** and **Hangman**.  
Built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**, it lets you invite friends, play locally against simple AI, and chat in real-time — all wrapped in a playful notebook-style UI.  

## Key Features

- **Online Multiplayer**: Invite a friend with a shareable game link  
- **Local Play with AI**: Challenge the computer when no friends are around  
- **Realtime Chat**: In-game messaging powered by Supabase Realtime  
- **Anonymous Login**: No sign-up required — just start playing  
- **Notebook UI**: A playful paper-inspired interface built with PaperCSS  
- **Cross-Platform**: Works smoothly on desktop and mobile  

## Live Application

2. **Invite or Join**: Start a new game and share your link, or join an existing match

4. **Solo Mode**: Try local mode against the AI for quick practice
